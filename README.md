HTSbox is a fork of early [HTSlib][htslib]. It is a collection of small
*experimental* tools manipulating HTS-related files. While some of these tools
are already part of the [official SAMtools][samtools] package, others are for
niche use cases in my own work, so are maintained by myself. Please keep in mind
that HTSbox is **NOT** the official repository. It lags far behind HTSlib in
terms of features, activity, clarity and robustness. If you are looking for a
high-quality library and related tools, the [SAMtools organization
repositories][github] are the right place.
